This project is part of the FNB app academy initiative an was built as a learning exercise to explore and practice key programming concepts using VS Code. It includes basic features and serves as a sandbox for experimentation rather than production use. Through building it, I learned about many fundementals with regards to coding. While it's a work in progress, future improvements may include better error handling, refactoring, and adding tests. Contributions and feedback are welcome to help improve and learn more.
